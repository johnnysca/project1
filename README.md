## Part 1: Eulerian Graphs
Return one of the three of type EulerPossibility, reflecting which of the three correctly
describes the graph input.
■ If the graph has neither an Euler walk nor circuit, the return value is sufficient.
■ If the graph has an Euler walk or circuit, indicate this in your return value. Before
you return, adjust the reference parameter journey to have the edges that
constitute the walk / circuit in order. Return them in such an order that the
second endpoint of one is the first point of the next

## Part 2: Topological Sort
Your input is a directed graph, which may or may not be acyclic (meaning it has no cycles). You are going
to output a topological order of the graph, sometimes known as a topological sort

## Part 3: Bipartite Checking
Given a graph, determine if it is bipartite or not.
